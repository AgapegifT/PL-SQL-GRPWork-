# Class Quiz â€“ Database Assignment

This project is an MySQL database exercise done as a class quiz. It covers creating tables with constraints, inserting data, performing joins, creating an index, and making a view.

## ðŸš€ What I Did

1. **Created Tables** â€“ `students`, `courses`, and `enrollments` with primary keys, foreign keys, unique email, and not null constraints.
2. **Inserted Data** â€“ Added sample students, courses, and enrollments.
3. **Performed Joins** â€“ Tested INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL (via UNION) joins to understand differences in results.
4. **Created Index** â€“ Added a composite index on `(student_id, course_id)` to speed up queries.
5. **Created View** â€“ Built `student_course_grades` to simplify access to student, course, and grade info.

##  Conclusion

This task helped us to practice key database concepts:

* Constraints keep data clean and consistent.
* Joins show different perspectives of related data.
* Indexes improve performance.
* Views make queries easier to use.
